      Welcome to Star Power Music!
    </p>
    <p class="flashy2">We are a dynamic musical school bursting with opportunities for students to learn and collaborate. </p>
    <p> At Star Power Music we believe that music is much more than learning a musical skill, or developing an ear for melodies, or increasing oneâ€™s mental capacity. Yes music does all that, but we are interested even more so in music as a way to build and maintain a community that thrives with culture, fun and initiative. Here kids and adults can receive world class instruction in their chosen instrument, and then enrich that knowledge by working together in ensembles with their peers.

With multiple performing opportunities at carnivals, plazas, parades and even theme parks throughout the year students not only share their music with their band mates, but also share their gifts with the wider community. As students gear up for performances, they set real life goals and find extra motivation to practice. Like the professional world, Star Power Music students learn to work together in teams with discipline, integrity, positive communication, and accountability to others. At Star Power Music we want our students to learn how to express themselves, collaborate in a team, work towards success, and <span class="flashy2">rock the stage!</span>
